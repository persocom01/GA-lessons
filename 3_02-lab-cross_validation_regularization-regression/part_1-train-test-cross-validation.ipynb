    "We've discussed overfitting, underfitting, and how to validate the \"generalizeability\" of your models by testing them on unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll practice two related validation methods: \n",
    "1. **train/test split**\n",
    "2. **k-fold cross-validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Train/test split and k-fold cross-validation both serve two useful purposes:\n",
    "- We prevent overfitting by not using all the data, and\n",
    "- We retain some remaining data to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of cross-validation, the model fitting and evaluation is performed multiple times on different train/test splits of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we can use the training/test validation framework to compare multiple models on the same dataset. This could be comparisons of two linear models, or of completely different models on the same data.\n"
