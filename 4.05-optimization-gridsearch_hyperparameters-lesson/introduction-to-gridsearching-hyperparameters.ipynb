    "\n",
    "Models often have built-in specifications that we can use to fine-tune our results. For example, when we choose a linear regression, we may decide to add a penalty to the loss function such as the Ridge or the Lasso. Those penalties require the regularization strength, alpha, to be set. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These specifications are called hyperparameters.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are different from the parameters of the model that result from a fit, such as the coefficients. They are set prior to the fit - usually when we instantiate it - and they affect or determine the model's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are often more than one kind of hyperparamter to set for a model. For example, in the KNN algorithm, we have a hyperparameter to set the number of neighbors. We also have a hyperparameter to set the weights, eithe uniform or distance. Generally, we want to know the *optimal* hyperparameter settings, the set that results in the best model evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The search for the optimal set of hyperparameters is called gridsearching.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gridsearching gets its name from the fact that we are searching over a \"grid\" of parameters. For example, imagine the `n_neighbors` hyperparameters on the x-axis and `weights` on the y-axis, and we need to test all points on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gridsearching uses cross-validation internally to evaluate the performance of each set of hyperparameters.** More on this later."
