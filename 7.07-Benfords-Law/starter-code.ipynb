    "## About Benford's Law\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> Benford's law is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the most significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the most significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on. - From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)\n",
    "\n",
    "Benford's law has many great applications in exploratory data analysis. To give an example, forensic accountants typically use Benford's law to screen for irregularities in financial reports. Financial datasets tend to follow Benford's law **unless human intervention is involved**, which can sometimes lead to fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "For today's lesson, we'll apply Benford's law to the [City of Austin's Online Checkbook](https://data.austintexas.gov/Budget-and-Finance/Austin-Finance-Online-eCheckbook/8c6z-qnmj) to explore anomalies in the data."
