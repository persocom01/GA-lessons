## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
1. **Describe** error due to bias and error due to variance.
2. **Define** overfitting and underfitting.
3. **Identify** the relationships among bias, variance, precision, and accuracy.
4. **Describe** and **implement** methods for reducing bias and variance.
