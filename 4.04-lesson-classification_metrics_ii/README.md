## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
1. **Describe** the inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity.
2. **Construct** the ROC Curve.
3. **Understand** how AUC ROC is calculated and **interpret** AUC ROC.
4. **Describe** methods for handling unbalanced classes.

---

## Student Requirements

*Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:*

1. Define true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives.
2. Construct a confusion matrix.
3. Calculate accuracy, misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and Brier score.
4. Compare the "cost" or "badness" of false positives versus false negatives.
