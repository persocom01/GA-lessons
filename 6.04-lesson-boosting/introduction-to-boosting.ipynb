    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is another ensemble method with a different approach to bagging. Boosting takes a weak base learner and tries to make it a strong learner by retraining it on the misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Base model fitting is an iterative procedure**: It cannot be run in parallel.\n",
    "- **Weights are assigned to observations to indicate their \"importance:\"** Samples with higher weights are given higher influence on the total error of the next model, prioritizing those observations.\n",
    "- **Weights change at each iteration with the goal of correcting the errors/misclassifications of the previous iteration**: The first base estimator is fit with uniform weights on the observations.\n",
    "- **Final prediction is typically constructed by a weighted vote**: Weights for each base model depend on their training errors or misclassification rates."
