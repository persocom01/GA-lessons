    "We often interpret probability like frequency.\n",
    "- If I run an experiment over and over again and one event (call it $A$) occurs frequently, we might say that $P(A)$ is quite high.\n",
    "- If I run an experiment over and over again and one outcome $A$ occurs infrequently, we might say that the probability of $A$ is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make this idea a bit more formal by assuming we can repeat an experiment a theoretically infinite number of times. Written out mathematically, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\text{number of times A occurs}}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with limits, that's okay! \n",
    "- The idea is that while we can't actually run the experiment an infinite number of times, if we ran the experiment 1,000 times, then 1,000,000 times, then 1,000,000,000 times, as we get closer to an infinite number of experiments, can we get an understanding of what $P(A)$ is?\n",
    "- Limits are fundamentally important to *how* lots of machine learning and statistics work, but we're almost always able to do our work without getting into the weeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we can find probabilities exactly by hand... but that quickly gets complicated. Instead, let's *estimate* $P(A)$ by leveraging Python to run some large number of experiments and seeing how frequently $A$ occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I am rolling one die and my event $A$ is rolling a 6, I want to use Python to \"roll my die\" many times and count how frequently I roll a 6 compared to how many times I rolled my die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we are estimating the probability of $A$ as:\n",
