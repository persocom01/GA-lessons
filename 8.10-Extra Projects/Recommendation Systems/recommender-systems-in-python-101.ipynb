    "This notebook is a practical introduction to the main [Recommender System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) (RecSys) techniques. The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.  \n",
    "The main RecSys techniques are:  \n",
    "- [**Collaborative Filtering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering): This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.   \n",
    "- [**Content-Based Filtering**](http://recommender-systems.org/content-based-filtering/): This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.  \n",
    "- **Hybrid methods**:  Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem."

    "Here we are using a very popular technique in information retrieval (search engines) named [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). This technique converts unstructured text into a vector structure, where each word is represented by a position in the vector, and the value measures how relevant a given word is for an article. As all items will be represented in the same [Vector Space Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model), it is to compute similarity between articles.  \n",

    "In this notebook, we've explored and compared the main Recommender Systems techniques on [CI&T Deskdrop](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/articles-sharing-reading-from-cit-deskdrop) dataset. It could be observed that for articles recommendation, content-based filtering and a hybrid method performed better than Collaborative Filtering alone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is large room for improvements of the results. Here are some tips:\n",
    "- In this example, we've completely ignored the time, considering that all articles were available to be recommended to users at any time. A better approach would be to filter only articles that were available for users at a given time.\n",
    "- You could leverage the available contextual information to model users preferences across time (period of day, day of week, month), location (country and state/district) and devices (browser, mobile native app).  \n",
    "This contextual information can be easily incorporated in [Learn-to-Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank) models (like XGBoost Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with ranking objective) or Logistic models (with categorical features [One-Hot encoded](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) or [Feature Hashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing)). Take a look in the summary my solution shared for [Outbrain Click Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction/discussion/27897#157215) competition. \n",
    "- Those basic techniques were used for didactic purposes. There are more advanced techniques in RecSys research community, specially advanced Matrix Factorization and Deep Learning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can know more about state-of-the-art methods published in Recommender Systems on [ACM RecSys conference](https://recsys.acm.org/).  \n",
    "If you are more like practioner than researcher, you might try some Collaborative Filtering frameworks in this dataset, like [surprise](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise), [mrec](https://github.com/Mendeley/mrec),  [python-recsys](https://github.com/ocelma/python-recsys) and [Spark ALS Matrix Factorization](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html) (distributed implementation for large datasets).  \n",
    "Take a look in this [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/gabrielspmoreira/discovering-users-topics-of-interest-in-recommender-systems-tdc-sp-2016) where I describe a production recommender system, focused on Content-Based Filtering and Topic Modeling techniques."
