    "- No need to hand craft features\n",

    "- Needs a large existing set of ratings (cold-start problem)\n",
    "- Sparsity occurs when the number of items far exceeds what a person could purchase\n",

    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- No need for a large number of users\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Lacks serendipity\n",
    "- May be difficult to generate the right features\n",
