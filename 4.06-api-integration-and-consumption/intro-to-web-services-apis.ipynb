    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are used to many **interfaces** in real life. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A door handle.** We don't care how a door works. All that we expect is that pushing or pulling the handle will open the door. In fact, the way the door opens (theoretically) could be entirely different each time we use the door. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **File->Print.** We don't care how the computer prints the document. All that we expect is that using the Print option in the File menu will print the document. In fact, the way the computer prints it could change every time the program is updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we also use many interfaces. The interface we use to a programming library is its function calls. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matplotlib `plot()`**: We don't care how the `plot()` function works. All that we expect is that calling this function (with appropriate parameters) will plot the data and return a graphic. In fact, how the function works can completely change from version to version. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These are APIs -- Application Programming Interfaces.** The functions that you call and the parameters you call them with make up the interface to a programming library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How does this extend to the web?** A Web API is a list of function calls that are made to remote servers. The function call is sent by encoding it as a URL (technically, as an HTTP request -- we'll discuss these later!). The function call typically returns a string of text (e.g. JSON)."
