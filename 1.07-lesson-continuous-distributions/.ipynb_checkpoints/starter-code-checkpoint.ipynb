    "If you add **any** independent random variables from **any** distribution... as long as you add enough of them, this sum will follow the Normal distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since the mean of random variables is just the sum of independent random variables divided by a constant, the Normal distribution also models the mean of independent random variables from **any** distribution (if we average enough random variables). \n",

    "**Because we often deal with sums (or averages) of things, the Central Limit Theorem causes the Normal distribution to appear all over the place.** This is good! Normality is the most common assumption we'll make about the distribution of our data or our errors. Normality underlies many of the inferential techniques that we seek to use. It is important for us to determine when Normality is a condition we've met.\n",

    "## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Give examples of the following distributions: Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal.\n",
    "- State the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>What is the Continuous Uniform distribution?</summary>\n",
    "<li> The Continuous Uniform distribution is a distribution that takes on an uncountable number of values with equal probability.\n",
    "<li> An example of the Continuous Uniform might be:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Randomly generate a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<details><summary>What is the Exponential distribution?</summary>\n",
    "<li> Just like the Poisson distribution is the Binomial distribution taken to the limit, the Exponential distribution is the Geometric distribution taken to the limit. The Exponential distribution models the amount of time until an event occurs.\n",
    "<li> Examples of the Exponential distribution might be:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The amount of time until a light bulb stops working.\n",
    "<li> The amount of time until a bus arrives at the stop.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<details><summary>What is the Normal distribution?</summary>\n",
    "<li> The Normal distribution is the most widely-known distribution. It is symmetric, bell-shaped, and is parameterized by its mean and variance/standard deviation.\n",
    "<li> Examples of the Normal distribution might be:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The intelligence quotient (IQ) of individuals.\n",
    "<li> The average values of 1,000 dice rolls.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<details><summary>Why is the Normal distribution seen everywhere?</summary>\n",
    "<li> The Normal distribution naturally models a lot of real-world phenomena. However, the Normal distribution also models the sum of **any** random variables and the mean of **any** random variables. We often count or average things, so this will pop up frequently. In addition, some distributions naturally are means/sums of other random variables (Poisson, Binomial, and lots of others we haven't officially discussed) so we can use the Normal distribution in lots of cases!\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<details><summary>State the Central Limit Theorem.</summary>\n",
    "<li> The Central Limit Theorem states that, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the sampling distribution of $\\bar{X}$ will approach a Normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n",
